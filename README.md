# Frontend Development with Rust and Leptos

This repository contains a collection of demonstration projects showcasing frontend development using **Rust** and **Leptos**. These examples are designed for educational purposes and are **not production-ready**.

## Getting Started

### Devcontainer Setup

This repository includes a **Devcontainer** configuration to streamline the development environment setup. **Please use it** to ensure all necessary dependencies and tools are correctly installed and configured.

### Running an Example

To run a specific example, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired example directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository_root>/packages/<example_name>
   ```

2. Start the development server using `trunk`:
   ```bash
   trunk serve
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to the local development server (usually `http://localhost:8080`) to interact with the example.

## Important Notes

- These examples are **demonstration-only** projects and are **not ready for production**.
- Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the examples.
